        <p>In college I was part of a student club, we organized technical workshops. We were to film a promotional video for the membership drive. We took some photos, videos &amp; audio clips of students and professors. I was tasked with editing and compiling them.<br /> <br />I finished arranging the clips &amp; listened to them,<br />they contained a lot of background noise from that room.<br /> <br />I read up on noise removal and used some tools, these were supposed to filter the unwanted frequencies.<br /> <br />It was about the same time when I was taking lectures for Fourier Series. Completely unaware of the fact that I had used Fourier Transform!<br /> <br />Now if you don't know what a Fourier Transform is, I'm here to get you<br />excited about it, without lecturing or defining it, at least not for some time.<br /> <br />It is an amazing concept and you can only imagine how useful it has been in maths and various fields of Science.<br /> <br />If science doesn't appeal to you, you probably shouldn't be reading further because it is all geeky down below, in case your're leaving... here tl;dr<br /> </p>
<p>It's used for</p>
<ol>
<li>Playing that song that you've set on rotation</li>
<li>Fueling up for your wanderlust ride</li>
<li>Meds &amp; Health Checkups</li>
<li>Capturing the pictures of starry galaxies and underwater sharks !</li>
<li>Pimping up your ride and wheelz</li>
<li>Flushing your poop</li>
<li>It can vaporize you, bow down to the F<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&uuml;hrer</span> Fourier !</li>
</ol>
<p>It's really late, gonna sleep. This is a incremental post so I'll be updating it often !</p>
